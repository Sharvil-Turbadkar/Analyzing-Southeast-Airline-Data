## Abstract: 
We created this project to help a fictional client, Southeast Airlines, in retaining its customers and get a holistic view of how a back-end data scientist and front-end analyst work cohesively to help a client in real-time
## Business Goals:
Which are the factors which tend to influence the satisfaction of the customers towards the airlines, and which is the most effective one?
Is there any solution which could help them stand out in achieving higher customer satisfaction in correspondence to Southeast Airlines?

## Technologies Used : 
Programs :R(dplyr, ggplot, tidyverse , data.frame)
Models Used: Random Forest, Association Rule Mining, MCA  

## Insights and Recommendations :

1.Older people
Customers aged from 60-85 tend to average a lower satisfaction. This could be resolved by providing more personal travel amenities for senior customers and taking additional care. For instance, Southeast airlines could provide wheelchairs at the airport. 

2.Female
Women tend to be detractors. We suggest that Southeast airlines should provide more feminine care to improve the satisfaction level. Additionally, they can also provide more help to the mothers who carry their babies. For instance, we can provide a separate area for them.
     
3.Personal Travel
It is observed that the people who are traveling on their own, tend to give a lower satisfaction rating. Therefore, to improve the user experience of personal travel customers, we suggest that a survey be conducted based on these customers. 

4.Economy Plus Class
Out of all the classes, the passengers of the Economy Plus class were the least satisfied. A possible reason could be that the customers have paid more for Economy Plus but did not feel that the additional services were worth the extra cost.

5. We can thus infer that southeast airlines have a huge influx of female white collar working passengers as personal travelers who travel in the economy plus are mostly women and tend to give lesser ratings . 
   
## Goals achieved: 
1. Develop strong data skills and get a high-level overview of how regression and classification models can alleviate business problems
2. Develop strong interpersonal and communication skills which helped me function with team members from different backgrounds 
3. Convert visualizations into feasible business decisions
