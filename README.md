# Analyzing-Southeast-Airline-Data
Analyzing southeast Airline data  for understanding reasons behind customer churn and making prescriptive recommendations in accordance  

We have created this project to help our client, Southeast Airlines, in reducing their customer churn. 
Southeast Airlines is one of the top-four airlines in the United States and has many regional airline partners throughout the country.
But similar to other airlines, it has trouble keeping its customers from switching to a different airline provider.
This is represented by a term called  “customer attrition”.
In order to reduce customer churn, Southeast Airlines had implemented a loyalty program for frequent flyers. 
This loyalty program was intended to keep customers with Southeast Airlines because the more that they flew with them, the more “miles”
that they would acquire.
These miles would allow the customer to rise through the different levels of service that the airline provided, while also allowing them the opportunity at free or discounted flights.
Many other airlines were also using similar programs, as it was the “accepted industry best practice”. 
	
However, there were problems with this.
For one, it was difficult to gauge the effect of the loyalty program on customer churn. 
The effects of these loyalty programs were becoming in question, as customers seemed to be valuing them less.
They also seemed to cause issues for the airlines, as well, as it was suggested that frequent flyer points were behind almost $12 billion of “loyalty debt” from these programs.
Moreover, it was difficult to track customer churn, in general, because it is a “lagging indicator”.

This was done by analyzing the Net Promoter Score data provided to us. 
A score above 7 categorizes a customer as a “promoter”, meaning that they are a good asset to the airline, and will likely help to increase their business.
Finally, a score below 7 categorizes the customer as a “detractor”, meaning that they are likely to switch to a different airline. 
Moreover, the overall NPS score can be calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors in a study by the percentage of promoters. 
Although this may seem like a simple process, it also gives the individuals analyzing the results the opportunity to examine certain attributes of the customers within the study.
